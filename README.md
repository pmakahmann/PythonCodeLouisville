# PythonCodeLouisville
Python project for Code Louisville September 2017 - A "Song of the Day" catalog

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create a catalog of songs that will eventually be used for a "Song of the Day" app.  This site would be
used primarily as an administrator site, but for now is open for full CRUD capabilities to all users.

How to Run:

1. You will need to install Python and Django to run the project.  If you do not already have them installed, links to the download pages are
included here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

***For the following instructions, Windows users are required to check the box to "install Python to PATH" during installation***

https://www.djangoproject.com/download/

2. Clone or download the project files onto your local computer.

3. Navigate to the directory in your command interface ( ../../../PythonCodeLouisville)

4. Run the following command: python manage.py runserver (or python3 manage.py runserver)

5. After running the server, you should be able to see the address and port (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8000/).  Copy and paste this address
into your browser and press ENTER.  You should now be running the website in your browser.
